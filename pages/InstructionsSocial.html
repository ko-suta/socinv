        Instructions for the social contribution
    </h3>

    <p>
        You are given <b>{{ player.social_endowment }}</b> to decide how much you are going to contribute <b>socially</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: <br>
        (1) The <b>private</b> contribution <b>(previous page)</b> is multiplied by a randomly determined
        <b>0.5 < factor < 5</b> to find out the <b>private</b> earnings.
        <b>Importantly</b>, the yield for the <b>private</b> investment you have
        made in this round <B><i>n</i></B> will only be available in
        the next round <B><i>n+1</i></B>.
        <br><br>

        (2) The <b>social</b> contribution entails the following conditions.
        The contributions of all <b>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}</b> participants are
        added up, the total contribution is multiplied by a <b>guaranteed</b>
        factor of <b>{{ Constants.social_multiplier }}</b>, and the
        resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is
        evenly split among all <b>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}</b>
        participants.
        <b>Importantly</b>, the yield for the <b>social</b> investment you have
        made in this round will be available instantly
        (i.e. at the end of the current round).
        <br><br>

        Your <b>total</b> payoff for each round equals the sum of your <b>private</b>
        and <b>social</b> earnings, plus the amount you did not contribute. <br><br>
