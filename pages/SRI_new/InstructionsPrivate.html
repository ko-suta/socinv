        Instructions for the private contribution
    </h3>

    <p>
        You are given
        {{ if player.round_number == 1 }}
            <b>{{ Constants.endowment }}</b>
        {{ else }}
            <b>{{ player.past_payoff }}</b>
        {{ endif }}
        to decide how much you are going to contribute, first (1), <b>privately</b> (this page),
        and then (2) â€” <b>socially</b> (next page).
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: <br>
        (1) The <b>private</b> contribution is multiplied by a randomly determined
        <b>0.5 < factor < 5</b> to find out the <b>private</b> earnings.
        <b>Importantly</b>, the yield for the <b>private</b> investment you have
        made in this round <B><i>n</i></B> will only be available in
        the next round <B><i>n+1</i></B>.
        <br><br>

        (2) The <b>social</b> contribution <b>(see next page)</b> entails the following conditions.
        The contributions of all <b>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}</b> participants are
        added up, the total contribution is multiplied by a <b>guaranteed</b>
        factor of <b>{{ Constants.social_multiplier }}</b>, and the
        resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is
        evenly split among all <b>{{ Constants.players_per_group }}</b>
        participants.
        <b>Importantly</b>, the yield for the <b>social</b> investment you have
        made in this round will be available instantly
        (i.e. at the end of the current round).
        <br><br>

        Your <b>total</b> payoff for each round equals the sum of your <b>private</b>
        and <b>social</b> earnings, plus the amount you did not contribute. <br><br>
